		  <h2>Countdown to <span class=purple>Experience For Beginners</span>:</h2>
		  <div id=cntdwn></div>
		  <p><strong>Applause for a Cause</strong> is a philanthropic production company that
		  writes, produces, edits, directs, and premieres a feature film (90
		  minutes or longer) every year in order to raise money for that year’s
		  selected charity. Applause for a Cause was founded on the idea that we
		  can do what we love to do and benefit a deserving beneficiary in the
		  process.</p>
		</section>

		  <h1>The Story</h1>
		  <div class=content>
			<p>It all began in the fall of 2010 when two Northwestern University
			students decided that they wanted to push the boundaries of student
			filmmaking. Sarah Jane Inwards and Alec Ziff embarked on a mission
			to make a feature-length film (90 minutes or longer) and choose a
			charity that would receive all of the proceeds. While the process
			would be strenuous, that did not stop them. Applause for a Cause was
			born.</p>

			<p>With the help of NU Channel 1, Inwards and Ziff led a team of 70 students (from
			freshman to seniors) who acted in, wrote, produced, edited, and directed
			Applause for a Cause's first feature. Over 300 moviegoers attended the red
			carpet premiere of RUΣH on May 20th, 2011. Applause raised over $1,500 for the
			Ronald McDonald House near Memorial Hospital in Chicago.</p>

			<p><em>But that was only the beginning.</em></p>
			  
			<p>Applause for a Cause is here to stay, currently in production on its second
			feature, Experience for Beginners, the proceeds from which will benefit the
			Make-A-Wish Foundation. Applause now encompasses more students, a larger budget,
			and its own equipment. Yet Applause’s vision remains the same: students have the
			power to create professional, industry-quality films while doing so for a
			greater good.</p>

			<h2>RUΣH <span class=gray>2011</span></h2>
			<p>Applause for a Cause produced the feature film RUΣH in the
			2010-2011 academic year. RUΣH is a comedy about six college freshman
			rushing fraternities and sororities, only to have their relationships
			change forever. Over 300 people attended the red carpet premiere of
			RUΣH on May 20th, 2011 and helped raise $1,500 for the Ronald McDonald
			House near Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago.</p>
			<p><em>Check out <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1987632/">RUΣH's IMDB page</a>.</em></p>

			<h2>Experience For Beginners <span class=gray>2012</span></h2>
			<p>Applause for a Cause is producing the film Experience for
			Beginners in the 2011-2012 academic year. Experience for Beginners
			is a dramedy about a woman mourning the death of her girlfriend
			whose life is turned upside down when a friend from high school, now
			pregnant, lands on her doorstep. Experience for Beginners premieres
			on May 18th-19th, 2012 and will benefit the Make-a-Wish Foundation.
			We hope to see you there!</p>
